# Digital Downloads

Each product within your store can have a digital download associated with it, a file selected from the file manager.

When that product is ordered, both the order completion page and the receipt email will receive a link to that file to download it.

When configuring a product to be a digital download:

- unless you are also shipping a physical good, change the Product is Shippable option to 'No' against the product
- set the **Offer quantity selection** option to **No, only allow one of this product in the cart**
- select a file from the file manager using the **File to download on purchase** option, on the Downloads and User Groups tab of a product.
- check that your product has an appropriately configured stock level, such as unlimited


::: tip Download Links
Links to downloadable files are not __direct_ links to files, they are instead unique links specific to the order placed.
These links expire after a number of hours (48 by default), to prevent hotlinking.
This number of hours can be adjusted via the Digital Downloads tab of **Store / Settings**, using the _Number of hours before digital download links expiry_ field.
:::

If you intend that customers can return to your site and re-download files further into the future, with a list of digital downloads they have purchased displayed, it is suggest to create a protected page on your site, and use user accounts to control access.
